# APIs-challenge
HW 6 for DU Data Analytics Bootcamp

For this project, I extracted data from the openweathermap.com API in JSON format, extracted the data for narly 600 randomly chosen cities across all latitudes and longitudes, and ran some analyses on weather data for those cities.  I looked at Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed and Cloudiness overall, and then ran regressions for the same measures isolated to the Northern and Southern Hemispheres with latitude on the x axis.

For part two of the project, I took the data from part 1, and created a worldwide heatmap by humidity.  I then defined my "ideal vacation conditions," narrowing the locations down to 15 cities.  Using Google's Nearby API, I located hotels in 14 of the 15 remaining cities and plotted their locations as a layer on the previously mentioned humidity heatmap.
